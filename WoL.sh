This utility sends a magic packet to wake up a machine properly configured to listen to Wake-On-LAN/WLAN requests.

   Usage:  WoL.sh [MAC] [IP] [Port]
   
   MAC:    mandatory, MAC address of the target machine
   
   IP:     optional, the magic packet will be sent to this IP
           default: 255.255.255.255 (broadcast to all IPs)
           
   Port:   optional, the magic packet will be sent to this port
           default: 9
